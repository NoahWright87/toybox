# Shmup Level & Enemy Editor — TODOs (PRD)

> Epic: **[Shmup Editor] Epic 6 #182**. Issues: **E1 #191** (tile editor —

> **E3 #193** (spawn node editor), **E4 #194** (preview/playtest), **E5
> #195** (export/import pipeline). Source: design handoff doc (Claude

## What this is

A browser-based authoring tool at **`/shmup-editor`**, used to create
tiles, enemy definitions, and spawn configurations for the shmup game's
data-driven level system (`specs/games/shmup/levels-and-tiles.spec.todo.md`,
`enemies-and-bullets.spec.todo.md`, `spawn-and-warnings.spec.todo.md`). It
will output JSON files that a human commits into the `games/shmup`
workspace as static content (the concrete hand-off mechanics are E5's job
— nothing lands there automatically yet).

Settled (see `shmup-editor.md` for the shipped slice): the editor is a
route in the **main app**, not inside `games/shmup`'s Phaser workspace;
it shares **no runtime code** with the game (only the JSON shape); tiles
persist via **fsStore**, not localStorage.

## Non-goals for this tool

- Not a general-purpose level editor for other games in the repo (e.g.
  Hellzone's `HellMapEditor.tsx` stays separate — different data model,
  different game).
- Not a live-preview-against-the-real-Phaser-bundle tool — E4's preview
  mode is a lightweight in-browser simulation of node-graph/spawn timing,
  not an embedded copy of `games/shmup`.
- No multiplayer/real-time collaboration — single-author, local browser
  session, export-to-file.

## Surfaces (build in this order — E1/E2 are load-bearing)

### E1 — Tile editor (#191) — partially shipped

**Done** (see `shmup-editor.md`): footprint picker, per-column edge tags
with hard-wall marking, start/end connector toggle, rotate/flip schematic
preview, tile list (edit/duplicate/delete), fsStore-backed persistence,
and a connection tester that validates tiles actually attach.

**Remaining:**
- Import/sketch real background art per footprint (currently a flat
  color swatch stands in for art).
- Attach spawn variants to a tile (needs E3's spawn-node editor to exist
  first — a tile variant *is* a spawn-node configuration per the design
  doc, so this is blocked on E3, not purely an E1 gap).
- Biome tagging on tiles (so a tile can declare which biome tile-set it
  belongs to, per L7 #189) — not yet modeled.

### E2 — Enemy editor (#192)

Pick sprite/image, build the node graph visually (place nodes, draw
edges), assign a movement behavior + params per edge, dwell behavior +
params per node, entrance appear-animation, exit node + exit type, attack
payloads on nodes/edges, branch conditions, per-param scaling curves, and
nested bullet payload(s) recursively via the same interface. Outputs
enemy JSON matching `enemies-and-bullets.spec.todo.md`'s data model.

### E3 — Spawn node editor (#193)

Attach one or more spawn nodes to a tile variant (origin/shape/direction/
mirror/timing/scaling), referencing enemy definitions built in E2.
Outputs spawn-node JSON matching `spawn-and-warnings.spec.todo.md`'s data
model.

### E4 — Preview/playtest mode (#194)

Preview a tile or a short generated sequence in-browser without a full
game import round-trip — validates readability/fairness (warning lead
times, bullet density) before export.

### E5 — Export/import pipeline (#195)

The versioned JSON schema for every authored type, the concrete landing
path inside `games/shmup/src/` (e.g. a `content/levels/` directory), and
in-editor structural + referential validation (a spawn node's enemy
reference must resolve, etc.) so a malformed export fails loudly in the
editor rather than crashing the game at runtime.

## Open questions (resolve before/during E5)

- Exact landing directory + filename convention inside `games/shmup/src/`
  for exported tiles/enemies/spawn-nodes/biome tile-sets.
- Whether tile/enemy art in the editor reuses the shmup sprite-registry
  manifest convention (`content-and-assets.spec.md`) directly, or needs
  its own lighter-weight asset-reference scheme suited to sketch/import
  workflows.
- Whether this tool ever gets a Doors 97 window/Taskbar entry (full
  `NsDoors97/CLAUDE.md` registration checklist) or stays a standalone-only
  dev route indefinitely, like Hell Map Editor.

## Reminders

- `shmup-editor.md` now tracks current (partial-E1) behavior; keep
  promoting sections here into it as E1's remaining gaps and E2-E5 ship.
